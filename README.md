# Front End Developer Test

We have provided a JSON file containing the records of 1000 customers. Using the front end framework of your choice, build a search interface that allows users to find a customer’s record, following the requirements below:

1. Users should be able to enter a text string into a form field, click the search button, and the application should return a set of results (Figure 1).
2. The search results should list: Name, Date of birth, Address, Phone number, Customer number, and an indication of the customer’s type.
3. If multiple results are found, a list of the results should be shown (Figure 2).
4. If a single result is found, a single result popup should be shown (Figure 3).
5. If no results are returned a No results message should be shown (Figure 4).
